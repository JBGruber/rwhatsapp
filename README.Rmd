# rwhatsapp

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JBGruber/rwhatsapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JBGruber/rwhatsapp) [![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/gh/JBGruber/rwhatsapp/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/JBGruber/rwhatsapp?branch=master)

## Motivation

WhatsApp seems to become increasingly important not just as a messaging service but also as a social network---thanks to its group chat capabilities.
Furthermore, retrieving chat logs from the Android or iOS app is very straightforward:
Simply choose `More` in the menu of a chat, then `Export chat` and export the history to a txt file.

![alt-text-1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBZvOb.png "menu") ![alt-text-2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1WoIb.png "more") ![alt-text-2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/c8uqJb.png "export")

This package is intended to provide some infrastructure to work with this text data in `R`.
So far it reads txt files into R and separates username, time and the messages into columns of a `data.frame` and extracts emojis.
**Please create an issue if you have ideas for what can be useful functions or if you have problems with the existing function:** [**issue report**](https://github.com/JBGruber/rwhatsapp/issues).

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("JBGruber/rwhatsapp")
```

## Demo

The package comes with a small sample that you can use to get going.

```{r}
history <- system.file("extdata", "sample.txt", package = "rwhatsapp")
history
```

The main function of the package, `rwa_read()` can handle txt files directly, which means that you can simply provide the path to a file to get started:

```{r}
library("rwhatsapp")
chat <- rwa_read(history)
chat
```

Now, this isn't very interesting so you will probably want to use your own data.
For this demonstration, I use one of my own chat logs from a conversation with friends:

```{r}
chat <- rwa_read("/home/johannes/WhatsApp Chat.txt")
chat
```

We write a lot in this group!
Let's see over how much time we managed to accumulate `r scales::comma(nrow(chat))` messages.

```{r messages_over_time, message=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("lubridate")
chat %>%
  mutate(day = date(time)) %>%
  count(day) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ylab("") + xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Messages per day") +
  theme_bw()
```

The chat has been going on for a while and on some days there were more than a hundred messages.
Who's responsible for all of this?

```{r echo=FALSE}
chat <- chat %>%
  filter(!is.na(author)) %>%
  mutate(author = gsub("\\s.*", "", author)) # I remove the last names here
```


```{r messages_per_author}
chat %>%
  mutate(day = date(time)) %>%
  count(author) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(author, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ylab("") + xlab("") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Number of messages") +
  theme_bw()
```

Looks like we contributed more or less the same number of messages, with Erika slightly leading the field.

Another thing that is fun to do is finding out what people's favourite emojis are:

```{r emojis}
library("tidyr")
chat %>%
  unnest(emoji) %>%
  count(author, emoji, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  top_n(n = 6, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(emoji, n), y = n, fill = author)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("") +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~author, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y")  +
  ggtitle("Most often used emojis") +
  theme_bw()
```

Looks like we have a clear winner: all of us like the :joy: ("face with tears of joy") most.
:sweat_smile: ("grinning face with sweat") is also very popular, except with Erika who has a few more flamboyant favourites.
I apparently tend to use fewer emojis overall while Erika is leading the field (again).

How does it look if we compare favourite words?
I use the excellent `tidytext` package to get this task done:

```{r often_used_words}
library("tidytext")
chat %>%
  unnest_tokens(input = "text",
                output = "word") %>%
  count(author, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  top_n(n = 6, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = author)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("") +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~author, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  ggtitle("Most often used words") +
  theme_bw()
```

This doesn't make much sense.
First of all, because we write in German which you might not understand :wink:.
But it also looks weird that Artur and Erika seem to often use the words "media" and "omitted".
Of course, this is just the placeholder WhatsApp puts into the log file instead of a picture or video.
But the other words don't look particularly useful either.
They are what's commonly called stopwords: words that are used often but don't carry any substantial meaning.
"und" for example is simply "and" in English.
"der", "die" and "das" all mean "the" in English (which makes German a pain to learn for an English native speaker).

To get around this mess, I remove these words before making the plot again:

```{r often_used_words_clean}
library("stopwords")
chat %>%
  unnest_tokens(input = "text",
                output = "word") %>%
  filter(!word %in% c(
    stopwords(language = "de"),
    "media",
    "omitted",
    "ref",
    "dass",
    "schon",
    "mal"
  )) %>%
  count(author, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  top_n(n = 6, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = author)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("") +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~author, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  ggtitle("Most often used words") +
  theme_bw()
```

Still not very informative, but hey, this is just a private conversation, what did you expect?
It seems though that we agree with each other a lot, as "ja" ("yes") and ok are among the top words for all of us.
The antonym "ne" ("nope") is far less common and only on Artur's and Erika's top lists.
I seem to send a lot of links as both "https" and "ref" appear on my top list.
Alexandra is talking to or about Erika and me pretty often and Artur is the only one who mentions euro (as in the currency) pretty often.

Another way to determine favourite words is to calculate the term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf–idf).
Basically, what the measure does, in this case, is to find words that are common within the messages of one author but uncommon in the rest of the messages.

```{r Important_words}
chat %>%
  unnest_tokens(input = "text",
                output = "word") %>%
  select(word, author) %>%
  filter(!word %in% c(
    stopwords(language = "de"),
    "media",
    "omitted",
    "ref",
    "dass",
    "schon",
    "mal",
    "android.s.wt"
  )) %>%
  mutate(word = gsub(".com", "", word)) %>%
  mutate(word = gsub("^gag", "9gag", word)) %>%
  count(author, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(term = word, document = author, n = n) %>%
  filter(n > 10) %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  top_n(n = 6, tf_idf) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n, fill = author)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("") +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~author, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  ggtitle("Important words using tf–idf by author") +
  theme_bw()
```

Another common text mining tool is to calculate lexical diversity.
Basically, you just check how many unique words are used by an author.

```{r Lexical_Diversity}
chat %>%
  unnest_tokens(input = "text",
                output = "word") %>%
  filter(!word %in% c(
    stopwords(language = "de"),
    "media",
    "omitted",
    "ref",
    "dass",
    "schon",
    "mal"
  )) %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  summarise(lex_diversity = n_distinct(word)) %>%
  arrange(desc(lex_diversity)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(author, lex_diversity),
                          y = lex_diversity,
                          fill = author)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = (mult = c(0, 0, 0, 500))) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::comma(lex_diversity)), hjust = -0.1) +
  ylab("unique words") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Lexical Diversity") +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_flip()
```

Overall, WhatsApp data is just a fun source to play around with text mining methods.
If you have more serious data, a proper text analysis might also be possible.
